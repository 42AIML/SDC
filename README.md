## Install the simulator
The open source donkey simulator is a good way to practice with the whole machine learning pipeline.
You can practice gather data from a car, transfering data to your main computer, cleaning the data,
training a model, deploying the model, and finally running the model.

You can essentially get familiar with the entire process of building an autonomous car.

1. Go [here](http://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/simulator/) to download simulator for your computer
2. cd to the directory with the simulator
3. Run the executable to use the simulator
